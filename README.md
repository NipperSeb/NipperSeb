Hi, I'm Sébastien Pincepoche.
Webmarketing internship from March 17 to July 22, 2024 - Rennes/Fougères.
For the past 5 years, I've been passionate about the digital and web professions, self-taught via e-learning courses. This year, I've taken the plunge. In the first half of 2023, I took a Web Developer course. I then joined the Bachelor Digital Project Manager program with the aim of becoming an SEO and/or SEA specialist.
